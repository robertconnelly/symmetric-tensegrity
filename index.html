      This is access to a catalog of several hundred tensegrity structures that
      are held rigidly together with incompressible struts and inextendable
      cables connecting point nodes. These structures are
      <i>highly symmetric</i> in the sense that there is a symmetry of the
      structure that takes any node to any other, there is a symmetry of the
      structure that takes any strut to any other, and there are two classes of
      cables, where there is a symmetry of the structure that takes any cable to
      any other in the same class.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)</h3>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>What is a tensegrity?</li>
      <p>
        It is a structure that joins nodes (points) with inextendibile cables and
        incompressible struts. The cable can be made from string, wire, or rope, and
        struts can be made from tubes, dowel rods, or just sticks.  See
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity">Wikipedia</a> for a reasonable
  definition.
      </p>
      <li>What is the mathematical definition of a tensegrity?</li>
      <p>
        It is a finite configuration of points, the nodes, in space or the plane where
        some pairs of the nodes are designated cables, constrained not to get further
        apart, and some pairs are designated struts, constrained not to get closer
        together. Note with this definition cables and struts are allowed to intersect and
        cross.
      </p>
      <li>Who first created a tensegrity?</li>
      <p>
        If you don't count spider webs and constructions in nature, an artist Kenneth
        Snelson is usually credited with the first creations. He has an interesting
        <a href="http://www.kennethsnelson.net/">website</a>.
      </p>
      <li>Who thought of the name tensegrity?</li>
      <p>
        Buckminster Fuller. It combines the notion of "tension" with "integrity", creating
        "tensional integrity". You can see Bucky's musings
        <a href="http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/rbfnotes/fpapers/tensegrity/tenseg01.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <li>Where can I read more about this catalog and tensegrities?</li>
      <p>
        <ul>
    <li>
      Allen Back and Bob Connelly have an
      <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~connelly/tensegrity.copy.pdf">article</a>
            in the March-April 1998 issue of the American Scientist that explains a lot of
            what goes into this catalog.
    </li>
    <li>
            There is the
      <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~connelly/second.order.pdf">paper</a>
      by Bob Connelly and Walter Whiteley that discusses some of the basic geometric
      principles for the stability of tensegrity structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bob Connelly and Maria Terrell have a 1995 paper, Globally rigid symmetric tensegrities,
            <a href="http://www-iri.upc.es/people/ros/StructuralTopology/">Structural Topology</a>,
      21, 59--78 that classifies a collection of super stable symmetric tensegrities.
    </li>
    <li>
      For engineering background see "Theory of Structures" by Timoshenko and Young.
    </li>
  </ul>
      </p>
      <li>What are some links to other sites that show tensegrities?</li>
      <p>
        <ul>
    <li>
      There is the older 
      <a href="http://mathlab.cit.cornell.edu/visualization/tenseg/in_progress/short_top.html">
        catalog
      </a> created by Allen Back and Bob Connelly.
    </li>
    <li>
            There is a <a href="http://complexity.xozzox.de/tensegrity.html">site</a>
            where a few symmetric and non-symmetric tensegrities can be viewed and
            rotated. This seems to be a kind virtual tensegrity, where the configuration
            minimizes an energy functional on the cables.
    </li>
  </ul>
      </p>
      <li>Can I build these tensegrities?</li>
      <p>
        Why not? Once you have chosen a particular example, you can read off the lengths
        of the cable relative to the strut lengths in the lower right window. The picture
        should help you thread the cables and struts. There is only one way to make the
        structure with those lengths if everything is hooked up right. There are various
        materials that you can use. Dowel rods with nails in them are popular as in Pugh's

      </p>
      <li>Can I look at the source code for the program?</li>
      <p>
  Yes. It is available on
  <a href="https://github.com/robertconnelly/symmetric-tensegrity">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <li>Will the structures shown in this catalog hold together?</li>
      <p>
        Yes. They are all rigid, but not all choices give interesting tensegrities. Some
        are very degenerate.
      </p>
      <li>How are the structures chosen?</li>
      <p>
        They must satisfy the following list of criteria: They must have
        the <em>symmetries</em> of one of the six <em>groups</em> A<sub>4</sub>,
        S<sub>4</sub>, A<sub>5</sub>, A<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>4</sub> x
        Z<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>5</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub>; There are two classes (each class is
        designated by its own color, usually red and blue) of cables such that there is a
        symmetry of the structure that takes takes any cable of one class to any other
        cable of the same class; For any two struts (colored brown or green), there is a
        symmetry of the structure that takes any strut onto any other; The cables are
        connected as a set; The whole tensegrity structure must be <em>super stable</em>.
      </p>
      <li>What does it mean that a tensegrity is super stable?</li>
      <p>
        This is a very strong condition on the geometry of the structure. There is a
        particular calculation that can be made in terms of the stress that exists in the
        structure. Certain numbers, called eigen values, are calculated. If they are positive
        with altogether only 4 of them being 0, the structure will be super stable. A
        consequence of this is that the structure is <em>globally rigid</em> in all
        dimensions. This means that if there is any other placement of the nodes
        satisfying the cable and strut conditions, then this placement will be congruent
        to the original. It will be the same configuration, possibly rotated or reflected
        and then rotated. Another consequence is that if you build this structure it will
        stay stable and rigid, even when the stress is increased relative to the
        stiffness. This is very handy for these tensegrities, since the stiffness of the
        cables especially tends to be very soft.
      </p>
      <li>
  If I have a tensegrity where all the nodes are the same, and it holds together,
  will it be in this catalog?
      </li>
      <p>
        Not necessarily. It could be rigid, but not super stable. Or it could have a
        different symmetry than one of the one of the six groups in this catalog. For
        example, the symmetric tensegrids described
  <a href="http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/advancedstructures/files/pdf/2009GuestD.pdf">here</a>
        have a symmetry group isomorphic a dihedral group.
      </p>
      <li>What is a group?</li>
      <p>
        It is a set where any two elements g<sub>1</sub> and g<sub>2</sub> of the set can
        be multiplied together to get another element g<sub>2</sub>g<sub>1</sub>of the
        set. The multiplication operation (or group operation) must satisfy the rules of
        associativity, inverses, and identity. See
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mathematics">Wikipedia</a> for more
        details. Presented this way, this is a definition of an abstract group. There are
        tons and tons of many different kinds of examples of groups. Here we concentrate
        on permutation groups, symmetry groups, and groups of matrices. (You can look at
        a book such as <em>Introduction to Modern Algebra</em> by Birkhoff and Maclane for
        a nice introduction.) This approach greatly simplifies the cataloging of the
        tensegrities we consider.
      </p>
      <li>What is a permutation group?</li>
      <p>
        This is a set of functions, called <em>permutations</em>, that permute the
        elements of some set. To be a group, any composition of these permutations in the
        group is another permutation in the group. We use the disjoint cycle notation for
        permutation groups considered here. Our groups permute the symbols 1, 2, 3, ...,
        n. The symbol (a, b, c, ..., d) means a -> b -> c > ... -> d -> a. In other words
        these symbols are permuted cyclicly. The product of these cycles means the
        composition of the corresponding cycles. It is easy to see that any permutation
        can be written as the product of such disjoint cycles. For example, (12)(345)
        means 1 and 2 are switched, and 3 goes to 4, which goes to 5, which goes to 3.
      </p>
      <li>What are the groups A<sub>4</sub> and A<sub>5</sub>?</li>
      <p>
        These are the alternating groups on 4 symbols and 5 symbols, respectively. These
        are all the even permutations of 4 symbols and 5 symbols, respectively. A
        permutation is <em>even</em> if when it is written in disjoint cycle notation, there
        are an even number of cycles of even length. For example, (12) is not even, but
        (12)(34) and (123) are even permutations. The group A<sub>4</sub> has 12 elements,
        and the group A<sub>5</sub> has 60 elements.
      </p>
      <li>What is the group S<sub>4</sub>?</li>
      <p>
  This is the group of all permutations of 4 symbols and has 24 elements.
      </p>
      <li>
  What are the groups A<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub>,
  A<sub>5</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub>?
      </li>
      <p>
        The G x Z<sub>2</sub> notation denotes the <em>cross product</em> which means that
        you take two copies of the group G, where one copy has a - sign attached. The
        group operation on the - acts like multiplication by -1. For example, -(12) times
        -(34) in S<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub> is (12)(34). The G x Z<sub>2</sub> groups
        have twice as many groups elements as G. So A<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub> has 24
        elements, S<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub> has 48 elements, and A<sub>5</sub> x
        Z<sub>2</sub> has 120 elements.
      </p>
      <li>Why are these groups chosen?</li>
      <p>
        These are isomorphic to groups of symmetries of the cube, regular tetrahedron, and
        dodecahedron. A<sub>4</sub> is isomorphic to the rotations of the regular
        tetrahedron. S<sub>4</sub> is isomorphic to the rotations of the cube.
        A<sub>5</sub> is isomorphic to the rotations of the regular dodecahedron. The
        groups A<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>5</sub>
        x Z<sub>2</sub> are the full group of symmetries, including reflections, of the
        regular tetrahedron, cube and regular dodecahedron, respectively.
      </p>
      <li>What does isomorphic mean?</li>
      <p>
        If G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> are two groups, an <em>isomorphism</em> is
        a <em>one-to-one</em> function f (when g is not h, f(g) is not f(h)) defined on all
        the elements of G<sub>1</sub> with values in G<sub>2</sub> such that for every g,
        h in G<sub>1</sub>, f(g)f(h)=f(gh), and every element of G<sub>2</sub> is the image
        of some element in G<sub>1</sub>. This means that from the point of view of
        formal group operations, G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> are the same. If two
        groups are isomorphic they must have the same number of elements, but, for
        example, A<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub> and S<sub>4</sub> both have 24 elements,
        yet they are not isomorphic.
      </p>
      <li>What is a symmetry group?</li>
      <p>
        It is a collection of rigid distance preserving functions of all of space, where
        each function transforms some set to itself. The group operation is the
        composition of these functions, and so to be a group, the composition of any two
        such functions in the group is also in the group. For example the rotations of
        regular tetrahedron, cube or regular dodecahedron are symmetry groups.
      </p>
      <li>
  Does the tensegrity always have a group of symmetries isomorphic to the group in
  the group window?
      </li>
      <p>
  Yes, but the tensegrity itself may have other larger groups of symmetries.
      </p>
      <li>What is the order of a group element?</li>
      <p>
        If g is a group element, then g<sup>n</sup> is g multiplied by itself n times. The
        order of g is the smallest n = 1, 2, ... such that g<sup>n</sup> = e the identity
        element. For example, the permutation (12)(34) has order 2, and the element
        -(12345) in A<sub>4</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub> has order 10. It is particularly
        easy to figure the order of a permutation when it is written in disjoint cycle
        notation.
      </p>
      <li>What does the group inverse mean?</li>
      <p>
        One of the defining properties of a group is that if g is a group element, then
        there is a group element g<sup>-1</sup>, where gg<sup>-1</sup> = g<sup>-1</sup>g =
        e, the identity element. g<sup>-1</sup> is the inverse of g. For example, the
        inverse of (123) is (321).  If g is of order 2, then g = g<sup>-1</sup>.
      </p>
      <lI>When I choose a group elements in the cable and strut windows, what does that mean?</li>
      <p>
        When the situation is not degenerate, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
        the nodes of the tensegrity and the group elements. Any node can be identified
        with the identity element of the group, and the two group elements in the cable
        window and the group element in the strut window are identified with cables and
        struts that are connected to the identity node.  Note that if g is a group element
        corresponding to a strut or cable, then the inverse element g<sup>-1</sup> also
        corresponds to the same cable or strut.
      </p>
      <li>I want the struts not to touch each other. How can I find examples where that happens?</li>
      <p>
        If the order of a strut is greater than 2, then there are two struts connected to
        each node. So you at least have to choose a group element in the strut window that
        is of order 2. But it still may happen that the struts will cross somewhere in
        their middle. This tends to happen for the groups with a Z<sub>2</sub>
        factor. (They have mirror reflection symmetries, and the struts will intersect
        their mirror image if the mirror intersects the struts obliquely.) But in any
        case, you can look at the picture and see if they intersect. If you try a
        different stress ratio in the last window, that might pull some of the struts
        apart. In some cases, you might need to adjust the thickness and zoom in to
        decide whether there is really an intersection or not.
      </p>
      <lI>What do those funny lines in the window on the right in the program mean?</li>
      <p>
  Each line corresponds to a particular representation of the group chosen. When you
        click in the right hand window, a vertical line appears through the point you
        clicked on. The horizontal axis corresponds to the ratio between the stresses on
        the two cables you have chosen in the cable window. The vertical axis corresponds
        to the stress on the strut. When the strut stress is below the top horizontal
        line, it is negative. When the strut stress crosses one of the curved lines, the
        tensegrity becomes unstable, but right at the line that it crosses, it corresponds
        to an equilibrium that it needs for its stability. We call the representation that
        correspondes to that line the <em>winner</em>.
      </p>
      <li>What is a representation of a group?</li>
      <p>
        It is a function that assigns to each element g in the group G a symmetry of some
        Euclidean space. But the Euclidean space may be of dimension greater than 3. (This
        can happen for A<sub>5</sub> and A<sub>5</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub>.) Suppose g goes to
        f(g), and h in G goes to f(h). Then we insist that f(g)f(h)=f(gh). f is called a
        group <em>homomorphism</em>. This is the same property as being an isomorphism,
        except that f may not be one-to-one or onto. The representation f(g) may be the
        identity for some g not equal to e, the identity. If f is one-to-one, then we say
        f is <em>faithful</em>. If the winning representation is faithful and
        three-dimensional, then you should get a picture where the number of nodes is
        equal to the number of elements of the group you chose in the first window.
